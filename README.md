## Workflow & Commands
* To check what files need to by saved and commited:
    * `git status`
* To add files to the stage to get commited later on:
    * `git add FILENAME`
    * You can also use `--all` or `.` instead of the file name to add all files that have to be commited.
    * Multiple files can be added at the same time by putting a space between the file names.
* To commit files use:
    * `git commit -m "MESSAGE"`
    * `-m` means that the next thing you type will be your message
    * Your message should be in present tense and be a short explination of  
     the changes done by making the changes included in the commit.
    *Commiting files takes a snapshot of them so that you can review changes made.
* To send your commits to github use: 
    * `git push`
    * This send all of your commits to github and changes
