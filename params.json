Both allow your to keep track of your \r\nprogress, but offer different funcionalities that work well together\r\n\r\n\r\n* Git\r\n    * Runs locally\r\n    * Allows you to take snapshot of your code\r\n\r\n* GitHub\r\n    *  Saves your commits in the cloud.\r\n    * Allows collaboration on the same project.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Initial Setup\r\nBefore using git and github you must first set up a few things.\r\n####Creating A GitHub Account\r\n1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)\r\n2. Click the green **Sign Up** button in the top right corner.\r\n3. Fill out the appropriate information.\r\n4. Select the free account.\r\n5. Click the **Finish Account** button    \r\n\r\n####Adding an SSH Key\r\nSSH Keys is the way you link your github to your cloud 9 so that it gives \r\nyou access to your github account. \r\n\r\n1. Navigate to your cloud 9 settings.\r\n2. Click on the **SSH Key** tab on the left.\r\n3. Copy the **Default SSH Key** to your clipboard.\r\n4. Head to your Github settings page.\r\n5. Click the **SSH Keys** tab on the side.\r\n6. Click **Add SSH Key**.\r\n7. Make the title **Cloud 9** and paste the SSH Key you ahve copied into the provided box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n####Git Config\r\nGit Config identifies the changes made to the repository as the name and email your input.    \r\n\r\n* `git config --global user.name YOUR NAME` to set your name.\r\n* `git config --global user.email YOUR EMAIL` to set up your email.\r\n* Since you type it in --global you dont have to ever type this again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n1. First type `git init` in your main repository where you are working from.\r\n    * If you initialize the wrong folder you can remove it by typing `rm -rf .git`\r\n    * This tells cloud 9 that you will be using more git commands so it allows you to use them.\r\n2. Once you make changes and save them you can use `git add`\r\n    * a further explination of git add is below.\r\n3. After adding you can make your first commit by using `git commit -m \"MESSGE\"`\r\n    * Further explination below\r\n4. On Github press the **+** button in the top right corner and select **New Repository**\r\n5. Put in the same exact name for your local repository as your github repository.\r\n6. **Create Repository**\r\n7. Make sure you select SSH.\r\n8. Copy the first line under **â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line** : `git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME .git`\r\n    * This connects your local repository to your github\r\n9. Copy the line of code after that : `git push -u origin master`\r\n    *This pushes your commits to github \r\n    *Further explination below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n* To check what files need to by saved and commited:\r\n    * `git status`\r\n* To add files to the stage to get commited later on:\r\n    * `git add FILENAME`\r\n    * You can also use `--all` or `.` instead of the file name to add all files that have to be commited.\r\n    * Multiple files can be added at the same time by putting a space between the file names.\r\n* To commit files use:\r\n    * `git commit -m \"MESSAGE\"`\r\n    * `-m` means that the next thing you type will be your message\r\n    * Your message should be in present tense and be a short explination of  \r\n     the changes done by making the changes included in the commit.\r\n    *Commiting files takes a snapshot of them so that you can review changes made.\r\n* To send your commits to github use: \r\n    * `git push`\r\n    * This sends all of your commits to github and changes your repository on github.\r\n    \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
